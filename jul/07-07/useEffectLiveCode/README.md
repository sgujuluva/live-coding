# useEffect (functional component)

Every component in react has a lifecycle (mounting, updating, unmounting)

useEffect hook was introduced to replace some of the most used lifecycle methods in class-based components (such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount)

**Definition:**

- A react hook that allows you to perform side effects in your components.

**Use case (examples of side effects):**

- fetch requests.
- manipulating DOM directly.
- using timer functions like setTimeout()
