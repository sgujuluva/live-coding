# Objects

## Exercise 1:
Create an object to store book details, making sure it contains at least the following information: 
- title
- author
- publication year
- number of pages

Add any other information you want.

Save the book in a variable and use a `console.log()` to print a message like this:

`The book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" was written by Douglas Adams. It's 193 pages long and was published in 1979`

## Exercise 2
Create an object to store movie details:
- title
- director
- year
- duration

Add also a method called `info()` to the object that when used prints a description of the movie to the console, like:

```
Title: Frances Ha
Director: Noah Baumbach
Year: 2012
Duration: 86 minutes
```

## Exercise 3

Create an object that represents a box, containing the following properties:
- width
- length
- height

Write a function (not a method) called `boxVolume` that accepts an object as a parameter and returns the volume of the box.

The formula to calculate the volume of a box is: `width * length * height`

## Exercise 4

Following the steps in exercise 3, this time create 2 boxes.

Write a function that accepts 2 objects as parameters, calculates the volume for both of them and returns the biggest value of the 2
