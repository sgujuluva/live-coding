# Deployment

deploying a project to any platform works in multiple ways, one of them (and the most common one) is by linking your github to your account on the platform you want to deploy to (e.g. vercel, netlify, heroku...)

once your github account is linked to your host account you can pick any of your repositories to deploy!
therefore your project needs to have its own repo in your github first.

the platform we recommend is vercel because it's optimized for react projects.

## steps:

- have the project you want to deploy saved in a github repo.
- make an account on vercel and link it to your github.
- choose the repo of the project you want to deploy.
- congrats! your project is deployed.


you can buy a domain from any provider you like (NameCheap, Domain.com, GoDaddy...) and link it to your deployed site.
